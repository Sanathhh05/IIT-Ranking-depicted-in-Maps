📌 Project Description: Interactive Map of IITs in India

This project is an interactive web map built using Python’s Folium library and data from an Excel sheet containing information about Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs).

The project takes in IIT data such as:

🏫 College Name

📊 IIT Ranking

🎯 NIRF Score

📍 Latitude & Longitude (Location)

🖼️ Image of the Institute

Using this data, it generates a map of India with the following features:

India State Boundaries – displayed using a GeoJSON file for better visualization.

Markers for Each IIT – placed at their respective geographic locations.

Stylish Popups – clicking on a marker opens a card-style popup showing the college name, rank, NIRF score, and an image.

Interactive Features – the map supports zooming, panning, and clicking markers to explore IIT details.

The final output is saved as an HTML file, which can be opened in any browser. This makes the project portable, easy to share, and visually engaging.
